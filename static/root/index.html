		  Welcome to shaginaw.xyz !
	  </h1>
	  <p>So far there's not much going on here but the idea is to have a cool website with all sorts of stuff. It will be at a different domain when we come up with a cool name but until then this is the one I have handy.</p>
	  <h2>
		  Coming soon:
	  </h2>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Keyboards with weird layouts</li>
		  <li>Information about hacking type projects (both failed and successful)</li>
		  <li>Guides on how to separate from centralized tech giants</li>
		  <li>Information about amateur rock climbing</li>
		  <li>A functioning website maybe</li>
	  </ul>
